# Resampling

By Resampling methods we understand repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to obtain additional information about the fitted model. 

Two methods are sound: cross-validation and bootstrapping. Cross-Validation can be used to estimate the test error associated with a given statistical method. Bootstrapping is used in several settings, mainly to provide a measure of accuracy of a parameter estimate or a given statistical learning method.

## Cross-Validation

The test error is the average error that comes up when trying to predict a response on a new observation that was NOT used in a training sample.

When no test set is available holding out data can be used.
