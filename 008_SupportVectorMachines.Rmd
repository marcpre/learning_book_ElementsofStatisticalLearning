# Support Vector Machines

SVMs were developed in the 1990 and are often considered as the best "out-of-the-box" classifiers.

## Maximal Margin Classifier

### What is a hyperplane?

In a p-dimensional setting a hyperplane can be defined as:

$$
\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p = 0 
$$

In a two-dimensional setting a hyperplane is simply a line. 

We can detemine if the above equation does not hold true, then we simply say:

$$
\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p > 0
$$

$$
\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p < 0
$$

That means that the point lies simply on one or the other side of the line.
