# simple Linear Regression
Simple concept for predicting a quantitative response $Y$ on the basis of a single predictor variable $X$. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$.

$$
Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1X
$$

## Estimating the coefficients

By minimizing the residuals via the least square approach we can fit the line properly.
