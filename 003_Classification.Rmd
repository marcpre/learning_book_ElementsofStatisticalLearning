# Classification

In many cases the response variable is qualitative. Often to these variables we refer also that they are categorial. 

## Why NOT linear regression

Linear regression is not appropriate in the case of a qualitative response. If we have have several categories that do not align with each other then we could create a single model for each category. However, the dummy variable  approach can easily be used for variables that have two categorial values.
