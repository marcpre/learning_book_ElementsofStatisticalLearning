#Moving Beyond Linearity

Besides staying with the linear model, we can lossen the assumption of linearity and examine simple extensions such as:

* *Polynomial Regression:* Extend the linear model by adding extra predictors that are raised to the power
* *Step functions:* These functions cut the range of K variables into several regions in order to fill piecewise a constant function.
* *Regression splines:* Basically, they divide the range of X into K distinct regions and fit a polynomial function to the data. However, these polynomial functions are constraint and fit the boundaries. This can in fact produce an extremely flexible fit.
* *Smoothing splines:* We basically minimize the residual sum of squares criterion subject to a smoothness penalty.
* *Local regression:* Similar to splines, BUT the regressions are allowed to overlap.
* *Generalized additive models:* Extend the above methods to deal with multiple predictors.
