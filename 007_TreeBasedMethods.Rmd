# Tree Based Methods

We basically use stratifying or segmenting predictors space into simple regions, typically using the mean or the mode. Such methods are called decision tree methods. 

## Regression Trees

The process for regression trees is as the following:

1. We divide the predictor space into non-overlapping regions
2. For every observation we that falls into one region, we make the same prediction. Simply the mean of the response values.

To create the regions we simply create high-dimensional rectangles. (boxes) We seperate these boxes by minimizing the RSS. As it is impossible to find every box, we simply use recursive binary splitting.
